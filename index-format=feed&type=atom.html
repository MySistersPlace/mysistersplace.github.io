&lt;p&gt;Through a grant application with the Ohio Domestic Violence Network, My Sister's Place has been awarded funding from the Allstate Foundation to bring&amp;nbsp;financial education, a matched savings program, job readiness and job training and microenterprise opportunities to survivors of domestic violence. Allstate is &quot;committed to helping survivors build their financial skills as a way to escape abusive relationships,&amp;nbsp;get safe, stay safe and&amp;nbsp;thrive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;&quot;&gt;Our Case Manager and Counselor have been trained in the Allstate's &lt;em&gt;Moving Ahead Through Financial Management&lt;/em&gt; curriculum and are using its modules in group and individual sessions. &amp;nbsp;Clients have an opportunity to save up to $1000 and have those funds matched from the Allstate Foundation grant dollars. &amp;nbsp;The Foundation notes that they are &quot;committed to using financial empowerment strategies to end the cycle of violence because research shows that financial dependency is the strongest predictor of a survivor's decision to remain, leave or return to an abusive relationship - even stronger than physical safety issues.&quot; &amp;nbsp;We are excited to see the difference that this opportunity makes in our clients' lives.&lt;/p&gt;
